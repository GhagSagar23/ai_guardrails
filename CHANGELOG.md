# Changelog

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

- `AiGuard` orchestrator with chained input/output pipelines: redacting scanners
  chain (each sees the previous scanner's transformed text) and the pipeline
  stops at the first scanner that blocks.
- Eight scanners:
  - `PiiScanner` — PII detection/redaction across US/EU/India locales, with a
    Luhn check on credit-card matches.
  - `SecretScanner` — API keys, tokens, and private-key blocks.
  - `PromptInjectionScanner` — heuristic weighted scoring of injection signals.
  - `BannedTopicScanner` — word-boundary topic matching.
  - `BannedPatternScanner` — arbitrary `Pattern`/`RegExp` matching.
  - `TokenLimitScanner` — approximate token-count ceiling.
  - `InvisibleTextScanner` — zero-width, bidi, soft-hyphen, and tag-char removal.
  - `SchemaValidator` — minimal JSON-Schema-subset validation of model output.
- Pure Dart, on-device, zero runtime dependencies.
